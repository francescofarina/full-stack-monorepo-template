What the 'nginx.conf file' does is that it instructs the Nginx containers to listen on port 8000 which is the same port as our Django application and it specifies two specific routing rules. The Nginx container has only one purpose – that is to serve the two folders locations – '/usr/src/app/django_files/static/admin/' and '/usr/src/app/django_files/static/rest_framework/' on the containers. Any requests to '/static/admin/' and '/static/rest_framework/' are routed to these folders respectively. In our Nginx deployment below, these container volumes are mapped to a PVC linked to a PV. Therefore, when the Nginx pods start on Kubernetes, traffic to the routes are actually directed to this PVC location. This PVC is the same PVC created by the Django job object. Thus we are able to serve the Django static assets from Nginx.
